The Ground Time Overshoot (GTO) is the share of flights exceeding the scheduled
ground time during a defined period.


$$
\mathrm{GTO} = \frac{N_e}{N} \times 100
\ [\\%]
$$

where

`$N_e = $` Number of flights with an actual ground time exceeding the scheduled ground time (over period `$P$`.)

`$N = $` Number of flights (over period `$P$`.)
