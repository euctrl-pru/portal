title: How this site is built

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# run setup script
source(here::here("_common.R"))
```


This portal is designed and built using the following principles:

* everything has to be version controlled
* adopt KISS principle: Keep It Simple and Stupid.
* build a static website
* use open source tools whenever possible

## Scaffolding

This website is a statically generated one: there is no CMS, no database, no
authorization server behind it. It is just a bunch of HTML pages. These pages
are generate by [Hugo ![Hugo](/images/hugo-logo.png){width="22" height="22"}](https://gohugo.io/)
either out of plain Markdown or R Markdown.

Hugo is a static site generator, i.e. it takes a description, generally a
template, of the pages you want to build and generates the relevant HTML.


### Repositories

We use [git ![git](/images/git-logo.png){width="22" height="22"}](https://git-scm.com/)
as our (distributed) version control system.
And we selected GitHub as the central server for our git repositories.

In order to group all our repositories we created a
[GitHub Organizations ![GitHub Organizations](/images/Octocat.png){width="22" height="22"}][ghorg]
called `euctrl-pru`. It is a sort of company/team account.

We have one repository for the *source* pages, [portal](https://github.com/euctrl-pru/portal),
where you can find and follow all we publish.


### Web hosting

Once we submit a change to the (master branch of the) `portal` repository,
[Netlify ![Netlify](/images/netlify-logo.png){width="22" height="22"}](https://netlify.com/)
triggers a build of the website and publishes it.


### Continuous Integration and Deployment

We use the continuos integration service of
[Netlify ![Netlify](/images/netlify-logo.png){width="22" height="22"}](https://netlify.com/)
to automatically

* build every commit in our release branch (any branch name starting with
  `2016<2 digit month number>-release`). These build can include tests to be
  executed in order to garantee a certain level of quality...

* build every `master` branch commit **and if successful** deploy the generated site.
  This is a way to publish our releases and make them available on the Internet.
  (*Less work for the Humans more boring work for the Machines*)
