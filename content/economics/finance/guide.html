<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of the dashboard is to create an online resource of ANSPs’ financial information and indicators with interactive features, which is accessible and allows for comparisons over time.</p>
<p>All information presented has been collected from ANSPs’ publicly available financial statements, where the financial information corresponds to the legal reporting entity as a whole and, therefore, in some cases differs from the data reported in the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/ACE/ACE-Home.html">ACE Benchmarking Reports</a>.</p>
<p>Financial information has been collected for the years 2017 to 2020, and the intention is to continue collecting data annually following the publication of annual financial statements. The objective of this dashboard is, as far as possible, to reflect the information as provided in each ANSP’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The data presented was validated with each participating ANSP prior to publication</p>
</div>
<div id="dashboard" class="section level2">
<h2>Dashboard</h2>
<p>At the top of the dashboard, users can select the ANSP and year for which data is displayed. All information and data displayed within the dashboard relates to the selected ANSP, and where a single year’s data is shown within a chart or figure, the data relates to the selected year. All time series figures and charts show data from 2017 to 2020 and are not altered by the selected year.</p>
<p>The top section of the dashboard provides an overview of the selected ANSP, including information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the organisational and corporate arrangements;</li>
<li>the additional scope of activities, in addition to the provision of ATC services to GAT; and</li>
<li>the average share of the ANSP’s revenue as a proportion of total revenue across all ANSPs in the Pan-European System over the period shown in the dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this section describes the three main sections of the dashboard. Unless otherwise stated, figures are expressed in national currencies and in nominal prices.</p>
<div id="income-statement-section" class="section level3">
<h3>Income Statement section</h3>
<p>Income statements report information on a company revenues and expenses throughout a year. The format of the income statements can vary across different ANSPs, in terms of which items are reported, the level of detail provided and where items are reported within the income statement.</p>
<p>The figures presented in the dashboard are based only on what is presented in ANSPs’ respective audited income statements (i.e. not incorporating the additional information or the level of disaggregation disclosed as part of the notes on financial statements) except in cases where depreciation and amortisation expenses are not reported in the income statement.</p>
<div id="income-statement-items" class="section level4">

operations, that is, before accounting for interest, taxes, amortisation and
other non-cash items.

</dd>
<dt>Operating income (EBIT)</dt>

level of profitability from operations after accounting for depreciation,
amortisation and other non-cash items (a negative value implies a loss).<br>

<dt>Pre-tax profit</dt>
<dd>Profitability measure representing earnings generated from operations,
after accounting for all (pre-tax) income and expenses.
A higher pre-tax profit value implies a higher level of profitability
(a negative value implies a loss).<br>
<span class="math display">\[\mathrm{Pre\textrm{-}tax\ profit} = \mathrm{Revenue}-\mathrm{Opex}-\mathrm{Depreciation\ \&amp; \ Amortisation} - \mathrm{Other\ NonCash\ Items} - \mathrm{Net\ Financial\ Income} - \mathrm{Other\ Income}\]</span>

<div id="balance-sheet-section" class="section level3">
<h3>Balance Sheet Section</h3>
<p>Balance sheets report on a company assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity at the end of the calendar year (except for NATS, which has financial years running from 1 April to 31 March the following year). The format of the balance sheets across ANSPs’ financial statements is relatively standardised, though some variation remains in terms of how some items are reported.</p>
<p>The figures presented in the dashboard are based only on what is presented in ANSPs’ balance sheets (i.e. not incorporating additional information or the level of disaggregation disclosed as part of the notes on financial statements).</p>

investments and pre-paid expense
</dd>
<dt>Non-current assets</dt>
<dd>A company’s long-term investments for which the full value will not be
realised within the accounting year.

</dd>
<dt>Current ratio</dt>
<dd>The ratio of current assets to current liabilities.
Liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations.
A ratio a above 1 indicates current assets are larger than current liabilities,

</dd>
<dt>Cash on hand days</dt>
<dd>The numbers of days of opex that can be paid for using cash and equivalents
reserves. Liquidity measure that measures the number of days opex can be

<h3>Cash Flow Statement Section</h3>
<p>Cash flow statements report cash inflows and outflows throughout the year. The format of cash flow statements, across ANSPs’ financial statements, is relatively standardised, though there is some variation in terms of how items are reported. It should be noted that not all ANSPs’ financial statements include cash flow statements; therefore, no information provided for these organisations in this section of the dashboard.</p>
<p>The figures presented in the dashboard are based only on what is presented in ANSPs’ cash flow statements (i.e. not incorporating additional information or the level of disaggregation disclosed as part of the notes on financial statements) except in cases where the capex is not reported in the cash flow statement.</p>
