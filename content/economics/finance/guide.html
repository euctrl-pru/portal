<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of the dashboard is to create an online resource of ANSPs’ financial information and indicators with interactive features, which is accessible and allows for comparisons over time.</p>
<p>All information presented has been collected from ANSPs’ publicly available financial statements, where the financial information corresponds to the legal reporting entity as a whole and, therefore, in some cases differs from the data reported in the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/ACE/ACE-Home.html">ACE Benchmarking Reports</a>.</p>
<p>Financial information has been collected for the years 2017 to 2020, and the intention is to continue collecting data annually following the publication of annual financial statements. The objective of this dashboard is, as far as possible, to reflect the information as provided in each ANSP’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The data presented was validated with each participating ANSP prior to publication</p>

<h2>Dashboard</h2>
<p>At the top of the dashboard, users can select the ANSP and year for which data is displayed. All information and data displayed within the dashboard relates to the selected ANSP, and where a single year’s data is shown within a chart or figure, the data relates to the selected year. All time series figures and charts show data from 2017 to 2020 and are not altered by the selected year.</p>
<p>The top section of the dashboard provides an overview of the selected ANSP, including information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the organisational and corporate arrangements;</li>
<li>the additional scope of activities, in addition to the provision of ATC services to GAT; and</li>
<li>the average share of the ANSP’s revenue as a proportion of total revenue across all ANSPs in the Pan-European System over the period shown in the dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this section describes the three main sections of the dashboard. Unless otherwise stated, figures are expressed in national currencies and in nominal prices.</p>
