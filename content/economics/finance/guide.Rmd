## Overview

The objective of the dashboard is to create an online resource of ANSPs’ financial information and indicators with interactive features, which is accessible and allows for comparisons over time.

All information presented has been collected from ANSPs’ publicly available financial statements, where the financial information corresponds to the legal reporting entity as a whole and, therefore, in some cases differs from the data reported in the [ACE Benchmarking Reports](https://www.eurocontrol.int/ACE/ACE-Home.html).

Financial information has been collected for the years 2017 to 2020, and the intention is to continue collecting data annually following the publication of annual financial statements. The objective of this dashboard is, as far as possible, to reflect the information as provided in each ANSP’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The data presented was validated with each participating ANSP prior to publication


## Dashboard

At the top of the dashboard, users can select the ANSP and year for which data is displayed. All information and data displayed within the dashboard relates to the selected ANSP, and where a single year’s data is shown within a chart or figure, the data relates to the selected year. All time series figures and charts show data from 2017 to 2020 and are not altered by the selected year.

The top section of the dashboard provides an overview of the selected ANSP, including information on:

* the organisational and corporate arrangements;
* the additional scope of activities, in addition to the provision of ATC services to GAT; and
* the average share of the ANSP’s revenue as a proportion of total revenue across all ANSPs in the Pan-European System over the period shown in the dashboard. 

The remainder of this section describes the three main sections of the dashboard. Unless otherwise stated, figures are expressed in national currencies and in nominal prices.


### Income Statement section
Income statements report information on a company revenues and expenses throughout a year. The format of the income statements can vary across different ANSPs, in terms of which items are reported, the level of detail provided and where items are reported within the income statement.

The figures presented in the dashboard are based only on what is presented in ANSPs’ respective audited income statements (i.e. not incorporating the additional information or the level of disaggregation disclosed as part of the notes on financial statements) except in cases where depreciation and amortisation expenses are not reported in the income statement.


### Income statement items


Revenue
:  Income generated from normal business operations.
   Common items include operating income, other operating income and grants.
    
Opex (Operating expenditure)
:  Expenses generated from normal business operations.
   Common items include staff (wages and salaries, employers' contributions to
   social security and pensions, etc.) and non-staff operating costs
   (such as services, materials, maintenance, etc.).
   It does not include Depreciation Amortisation and Other non-cash Items (defined below).

Depreciation and amortisation
:  Accounting expenses (which do not involve a cash payment) representing either,
   the cost of tangible assets (depreciation) or the lowering of the value of
   intangible assets (amortisation), spread over their useful life or a set period.
   Note that for ANSPs applying IFR16, leased assets incur depreciation costs. 

Other non-cash items
:  The net total of income and expenses (except depreciation and amortisation)
   that do not involve a cash payment.
   Common items include capitalised costs, impairment and disposal of capital
   assets, and provisions for expenses (and/or reversals of these).

Net financial income/expense
:  The net total of income and expenses from financing activities (including
   investments and borrowing) and the change in value of financial assets.
   Common items include interest income and expenses, gains and losses on
   foreign currency transactions, and gains and losses on financial assets. 

Other income/expense[^1]
:  The net total of income and expenses generated from sources not directly
   related to normal business operations.
   Common items include income from joint ventures and subsidiaries and,
   exceptional income and expenses.

### Income statement profitability measures and ratios

EBITDA[^2]
:  Profitability measure representing earnings generated from normal business
   operations, that is, before accounting for interest, taxes, amortisation and
   other non-cash items.
   A higher EBITDA value implies a higher level of profitability from normal
   operations (a negative value implies a loss).<br>
   $\mathrm{EBITDA} = \mathrm{Revenue} - \mathrm{Opex}$
   
   
Operating income (EBIT)
:  Profitability measure representing earnings generated from operations,
   before deduction of interest and taxes. A higher EBIT value implies a higher
   level of profitability from operations after accounting for depreciation,
   amortisation and other non-cash items (a negative value implies a loss).<br>
   $\mathrm{EBIT} = \mathrm{Revenue} - \mathrm{Opex} - \mathrm{Depreciation\ Amortisation} - \mathrm{Other\ NonCash\ Items}$
