The [Standard Inputs document][ectl_sti] provides a set of standard inputs for data commonly used in economic and financial ATM-related analyses and appraisals. The standard inputs can save time in the development, for example, of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) and economic impact assessments and will also help achieve greater consistency and comparability between different CBAs.

The standard inputs have been compiled from EUROCONTROL data and intelligence, from values provided by airspace users, ANSPs, airports, IATA, EASA and other organisations, and from other relevant documents which are publicly available.

They are average values and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. The document also gives details of the sources of information, and discusses the applicability and use of the values.
