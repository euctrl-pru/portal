Data updates up to May 2019.

The following changes have been delivered in this release:

1. **Update**: Data download files updated up to **Apr 2019** (when applicable).
1. **Just published**: The [Performance Review Report 2018][prr2018fin], produced by EUROCONTROL’s independent Performance Review Commission, is now available for download. The report is a valuable tool for stakeholders across the aviation industry. It provides an assessment of European Air Traffic Management performance in all EUROCONTROL’s 41 Member States, covering the key performance areas of Safety, Capacity, Environment and Cost-Efficiency. <br> 

En-route ATFM delays increased for the fifth consecutive year in 2018. However, the increase was clearly disproportional in 2018. While air traffic increased by 3.8% over 2017, the en-route ATFM delays (i.e. excluding airport ATFM delays) more than doubled in 2018 (+104%) to reach 19 million minutes. This means that more than 1 million flights were delayed by en-route ATFM regulations in the EUROCONTROL area in 2018, which corresponds to 9.6% of all flights.
