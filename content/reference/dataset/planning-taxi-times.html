<h2>Data description</h2>
<p>Using data received directly from airlines, EUROCONTROL CODA (Central office for Delay Analysis) provides seasonal taxi time statistics for both the IATA Winter Season and the IATA summer seasons.</p>
<p>These taxi times are calculated using the airline reported actual off-block time (AOBT), actual take-off time (ATOT), actual landing time (ALDT) and actual in-block time (AIBT) providing the aviation community with seasonal benchmark values.
Furthermore for additional granularity, taxi-out times by wake turbulence category are also offered for a number of airports.
See the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/eurocontrol-specification-aodf" target="_blank">EUROCONTROL Specification for Operational ANS Performance Monitoring - Air Transport Operator Data Flow (AODF)</a> for a full description and overview of operational data items (incl. AOBT, ATOT, ALDT &amp; AIBT) collected from airlines.</p>

<h3>Calculated Field(s)</h3>
<p>Taxi-Out: airline reported actual take-off time (ATOT) - actual off-block time (AOBT)</p>

<h3>Applied filters</h3>
<p>Extreme outliers (taxi-in exceeding 120 minutes and taxi-out exceeding 180 minutes) are excluded from the calculation.
Only airports with at least 100 observations during the reporting period are listed.</p>
<p>The taxi-time report is based on the following 3 wake turbulence categories: M (medium), H (heavy) or J (super) with aircraft in wake turbulence category L (light) not taken in to account.</p>
<ul>
<li>L: aircraft with a maximum certified take off mass of 7000 kg or less.</li>
<li>M: with a maximum certified take off mass of less than 136000 kg but more than 7000 kg.</li>
<li>H: aircraft with a maximum certified take off mass of less than 560000kg but more than 136000 kg.</li>
<li>J: aircraft with a maximum certified take off mass of 560000kg or more.</li>
