## Data source
The data is supplied by the [EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit][env].


## Data description
The CO2 emissions were calculated with the EUROCONTROL [Small Emitters Tool (SET)][set],
which enables to estimate the fuel burn and associated CO2 emissions for an entire flight.
Hence, the results reflect total CO2 emissions from controlled flights rather than ANSP/ATM performance. 

The **total CO2 emissions for each State** were calculated based on **departing [IFR](/acronym/ifr/) flights**
billed by the [EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office][crco],
**aircraft type** and **actual flown distance** (full trajectory from origin to destination). 

For instance, the total CO2 emissions for the full trajectory of a flight from Brussels to
New York would be included in the results for Belgium. 
A flight from New York to Brussels would however NOT be included in the results for Belgium.
