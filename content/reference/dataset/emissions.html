<h2>Data description</h2>
<p>The CO2 emissions were calculated with the EUROCONTROL <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/tool/small-emitters-tool" title="small emitters tool">Small Emitters Tool (SET)</a>, which enables to estimate the fuel burn and associated CO2 emissions for an entire flight considering the characteristics of the air traffic covered by the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). Hence, the results reflect total CO2 emissions from controlled flights rather than ANSP/ATM performance.</p>
<p>The <strong>total CO2 emissions for each State</strong> were calculated based on <strong>departing <a href="/acronym/ifr/">IFR</a> flights</strong> billed by the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/crco" title="EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office">EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office</a>, <strong>aircraft type</strong> and <strong>actual flown distance</strong> (full trajectory from origin to destination).</p>
<p>For instance, the total CO2 emissions for the full trajectory of a flight from Brussels to New York would be included in the results for Belgium.
A flight from New York to Brussels would however NOT be included in the results for Belgium.</p>
