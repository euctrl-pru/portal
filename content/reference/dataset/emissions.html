<h2>Data description</h2>
<p>The CO2 emissions were calculated with the EUROCONTROL <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/tool/small-emitters-tool" title="small emitters tool">Small Emitters Tool (SET)</a>,
which enables to estimate the fuel burn and associated CO2 emissions for an entire flight.
Hence, the results reflect total CO2 emissions from controlled flights rather than ANSP/ATM performance.</p>
<p>The <strong>total CO2 emissions for each State</strong> were calculated based on <strong>departing <a href="/acronym/ifr/">IFR</a> flights</strong>
billed by the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/crco" title="EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office">EUROCONTROL Route Charges Office</a>,
<strong>aircraft type</strong> and <strong>actual flown distance</strong> (full trajectory from origin to destination).</p>
<p>For instance, the total CO2 emissions for the full trajectory of a flight from Brussels to
New York would be included in the results for Belgium.
A flight from New York to Brussels would however NOT be included in the results for Belgium.</p>
