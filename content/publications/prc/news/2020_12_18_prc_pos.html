<p>In early 2020, safety experts were asked for their views on emerging safety challenges from the evolving ATM system. The objective was to collect a wide spectrum of expert views on future challenges to safety and how to identify and measure potential risks in a changing ATM environment.</p>
<p>Building on this initial exchange, the PRC held a <a href="/publications/prc/news/2020_06_29_prc_ws_saf/">Workshop on 29 June 2020</a> that deepened the discussion. The Workshop was a starting point in defining safety performance objectives/focus areas for the future ATM system. The Workshop itself served as a platform to collect intelligence about “what do we know” and “what is available”.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to develop a safety performance framework that would support the implementation of changes (new concepts, technologies, and processes) in the future ATM environment. It should be seen as a contribution to better understanding of the possible changes to the ATM system and their possible impact on safety.</p>
<p>The PRC Position Paper presents an attempt to summarize all intelligence received and to identify safety performance Focus Areas for the development of a future safety performance framework.</p>
