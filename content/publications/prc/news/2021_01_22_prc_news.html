<p><strong>News</strong>: <a href="/publications/studies/2021_01_22_tn_cri" title="Composite Risk Index Methodology">Updated CRI methodology now available</a><br></p>
<p>In 2019, the PRC published its concept of the Composite Risk Index (CRI) as an innovative option to measure the safety performance of the European ATM system.</p>
<p>All safety programmes desire accurate safety risk quantification in order to provide a meaningful expression of risk. As there are typically multiple safety risks associated with a system or event, the quantification of the total safety risk is a major challenge.</p>
<p>One possible way to define the total safety risk is the concept of a Composite Risk Index (CRI) which aims at measuring the performance of ATM system as a whole and/or its individual entities (service providers or Member States). The proposed CRI methodology presents a cumulative risk value, calculated by aggregating all reported, assessed and severity classified safety-related incidents which also takes the human perception of the equivalent risk into account.</p>
<p>The CRI methodology was now improved to better take account of local specific operating conditions, airspace size, and complexity.</p>
