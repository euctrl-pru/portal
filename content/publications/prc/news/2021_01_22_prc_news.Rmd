**News**: [Composite Risk Index Methodology][cri]<br> 
All safety programmes desire accurate safety risk quantification in order to provide a meaningful expression of risk. As there are typically multiple safety risks associated with a system or event, the quantification of the total safety risk is a major challenge.
One possible way to define the total safety risk is the concept of a Composite Risk Index (CRI) which aims at measuring the performance of ATM system as a whole and/or its individual entities (service providers or Member States). The proposed CRI methodology presents a cumulative risk value, calculated by aggregating all reported, assessed and severity classified safety-related incidents which also takes the human perception of the equivalent risk into account.
