<p>A growing number of empty passenger aircraft are operating freight-only flights, finds our latest Data Snapshot, which looks at the growth of air cargo during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Since COVID struck, all-cargo has remained the only market segment to stay above 2019 flight counts, with a current market share of 10-11%, 3 or 4 times its normal level.</p>
<p>The extra capacity has been met in part by using empty passenger aircraft to carry cargo, even with cargo in passenger compartments.
In January 2021, of the 33,400 cargo flights across the network, 5,400 were passenger-as-cargo planes.</p>

<p>The fourth EUROCONTROL Data Snapshot expands on the fact that half of CO₂ emissions come from just 6% of flights: the long-haul ones.</p>
<p>For some routes, only aviation can provide a timely connection. This is true for some shorter hops, over water or where a land connection is difficult, but mostly this is a question of distance. In 2020, some 6% of flights from European airports were clearly long-haul, crossing more than 4000km.</p>
<p>For passengers and for urgent or high-value cargo, there is little or no alternative on such routes. The importance of long-haul is even more clear when measured in capacity, rather than flights. For example, on the passenger side these 6% of flights carry 10% of total seats, and more than 40% of seat-kilometres (the usual measure of passenger capacity in the industry).</p>

<p>The EUROCONTROL Data Snapshot reveals that COVID-19 has massively reduced the number of flights by Airbus aircraft across the network, reversing a decade-long trend.</p>
<p>Our analysis of how the main aircraft manufacturers have performed in terms of the number of flights operated by their aircraft in Europe over the last decade shows how Airbus steadily increased market share from 2008 to 2019, overtaking Boeing around 2011.</p>
<p>However, the pandemic has hit Airbus much harder than Boeing in terms of flights, notably in the long-haul sector with many more Boeing 777/747 flights than ones by Airbus 330/380s as cargo ops predominated.</p>
<p>While the proportion of flights using Boeings has remained stable, flights on aircraft made by other manufacturers have their market share rise significantly – mostly smaller aircraft on domestic flights, and helicopters out to oil rigs.</p>

<p>CO2 emissions fell by 57% in the EUROCONTROL network area in 2020 – but, as our latest EUROCONTROL Data Snapshot 2020 shows, that breaks down into big variations across States.</p>
<p>We reveal that country-level variance reflects a number of factors – not just the number of flights operated, but also the distance flown, aircraft age/size and their market segment mix.</p>

<p>In normal times the published airline schedules are a pretty good indicator of how many scheduled flights there will be – indeed often analysts use them as a proxy for real flights. Inevitably, there are a few cancellations on the day (typically 1-2% according to our CODA reports) but the vast majority of scheduled flights do actually fly.</p>
<p>These are not normal times. One stark indicator of the volatility of COVID-related travel restrictions in the last 10 months is the fraction of scheduled flights which were actually operated, even in the week immediately after the schedule was published. As the lockdown spread across Europe, a huge gap opened between scheduled and flown: the low-point being just 24% flown on 29 March 2020.</p>
