When traffic demand is anticipated to exceed the declared [ATM](/acronym/atm/) capacity, [ATC](/acronym/atc/) units may call for “[ATFM](/acronym/atfm/) regulations”. 
Aircraft subject to ATFM regulations are held at the departure airport according to “ATFM slots” allocated by the [Network Manager](/acronym/nm-cfmu/). 

The resulting [ATFM delays](/definition/atfm-delay/) of a flight is allocated to the most constraining ATC unit, either en-route (en-route ATFM delay) or departure/arrival airport (airport ATFM delay). Please note that the ATFM delay is based on the flight plan. For information on delay compared to airline schedule or punctuality please see the [all-causes delay](/capacity/tot_dly/) section.

The overview below shows an analysis of ATFM delays and the [delay cause](/definition/atfm-delay-codes/) as attributed by the local [Flow Management Position (FMP)](/acronym/fmp/) in the [EUROCONTROL area](/definition/eurocontrol-area/). 

The underlying data is available for download in the [data section](/data/).
