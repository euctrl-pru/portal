EUROCONTROL PRU is engaged in a series of international comparison projects. 

*	United States / Europe - Since 2003, FAA and EUROCONTROL have jointly produced comparisons of operational performance using common data and agreed algorithms. As of 2013, the US/Europe comparison is performed under a Memorandum of Cooperation between the United States and the European Union. The series comprises reports for 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 (published April 2019). In light of COVID19, a more tailored comparison for the 2020 and 2021 is planned focussing on the regional response / impact of COVID19. The next regular (i.e. post-COVID) US/Europe comparison is foreseen for 2023.

*	Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Brazil, United States, Europe - Under the umbrella of a tri-partite benchmarking, Singapore CAA, FAA, and EUROCONTROL prepared a first joint internal report in 2017. The scope of this initial study comprised Changi airport and a set of comparable airports in the US and Europe. Japan and Thailand have subsequently joined this project. As of 2020 Brazil is also participating to this multi-regional project. The parties cooperate on the basis of the operational ICAO GANP KPIs harmonising the common understanding of data and analytical concepts. Technical papers about the multi-regional comparison have been presented to ICAO Asia-Pacific over the past years and to the ICAO ANS Conference 13 (summer 2018). An update of the internal report is planned for 2021. Work is also on-going on a COVID related public briefing.  

*	In collaboration with the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority and Civil Aviation University work is on-going to identify and move towards an initial regional comparison. The work revolves around a subset of mutually agreed indicators on the basis of the operational ICAO GANP indicators.

*	A further benchmarking activity has been launched with Brazil (DECEA) and revolves around assessing the operational ANS performance at airports and en-route airspace capacity. The publication of the initial comparison report is foreseen during the first half of 2021.
