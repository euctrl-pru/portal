<p>The US/Europe comparison is a long standing cooperation culminating in the joint publications of the Air Traffic Organization System Operations Services of the FAA and EUROCONTROL. The scope addresses regional comparisons with a view to the economic and operational performance of both air navigation systems.</p>
<p>The cooperation started back in 2003. As of 2013, the cooperation is framed by Appendix 2 to Annex 1 of the Memorandum of Cooperation NATI-9406A signed between the United States of America and the European Union on 13 December 2017. The work is coordinated under the umbrella of the MOC by a joint Performance Analysis Review Committee (PARC). The series of reports builds on the body of work developed since 2009 between the FAA and EUROCONTROL.</p>
<p>The overall objective is to make a factual high-level comparison of Air Traffic Management performance between the U.S. and Europe with a view to its economic and operational performance. The work is based on a set of comparable performance indicators, developed jointly and reviewed year after year, creating a sound basis for factual comparisons between countries and world regions. The specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are based on best practices from both the Air Traffic Organization System Operations Services and the Performance Scheme of the Single European Sky initiative and EUROCONTROL’s Performance Review System.</p>

<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had a devastating impact on the global aviation affecting the entire value chain from aircraft manufacturers to the ANS providers.</p>
<p>This special report is the seventh in a series of joint comparisons between the U.S. and Europe. It aims at understanding the operational and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic unfolding in early 2020 on the ATM systems in the U.S. and in Europe.</p>

In 2003, the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Commission (PRC) in collaboration with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) carried out a comparison of economic performance (productivity and cost-effectiveness) in selected US and European en-route centres.</p>
<p>Building on this previous work, this report, commissioned by the Performance Review Commission examines several key performance indicators derived from comparable operations databases for both EUROCONTROL and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This research effort developed a comparable population of operations data and harmonized assessment techniques for developing reference conditions for assessing performance. In the end, measures that address efficiency, punctuality and predictability are presented that can compare high level performance between the two systems by phase of flight.

This report, commissioned by the Performance Review Commission provides a comparison of selected US and European en-route centres (2001). It has found that the US centres are significantly more cost-effective.
While the results from the different centres (Barcelona, Karlsruhe, London, Maastricht, Reims and Roma in Europe, Albuquerque, Cleveland and Indianapolis in the US) are diverse, the operating costs per flight-hour controlled in the selected European centres were, on average, more than 60% higher than those in the selected US centres.
