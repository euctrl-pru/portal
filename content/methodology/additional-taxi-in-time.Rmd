The document describing the methodology for the calculation of the additional taxi-in time can be downloaded [here](/library/ATXIT_indicator_documentation_mar23.pdf).

This methodology is the result of a review process of the previous methodology (used up to December 2022 in the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System). 

The review was done in collaboration with stakeholders through the creating of a working group. All details about the review work can be found [here](/publications/studies/2022_11_17_prc_apt_cons/).

The new methodology is applied starting with the analysis of January 2023 performance and retroactively to 2015.
