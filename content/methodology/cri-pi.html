<p>This document provides a technical description of the methodology used to calculate the Composite Risk Index (CRI).</p>
<p>The CRI represents a cumulative risk value aggregating all reported, assessed and severity classified safety-related incidents to form an index. This measure of risk exposure is based on probability and severity that considers the human perception of equivalent risk.</p>
<p>Note that CRI can be calculated for any given entity, provider or the State.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:cri-components">1</a> shows all components of proposed CRI index.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>As a proxy of safety risk within certain airspace, State, or any Entity, the concept of exposure to risk, based on reported / historical safety information was proposed.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the composite risk, each historical, reported occurrence had to have assigned severity (using Risk Assessment Tool methodology) and probability (calculated from historical safety data).</p>
<p>Modelling can be performed using any source of safety occurrences data, as long as the input satisfies the minimum data requirements.</p>
<p>The CRI calculations are based on the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidents</li>
<li>Operation occurrences (high/medium risk incidents with Severity A to C):
<ul>
<li>runway incursions (RI)</li>
<li>separation minima infringements (SMI)</li>
<li>unauthorized penetrations of airspace (UPA)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other operational occurrences</li>
<li>Technical occurrences (high/medium risk incidents with Severity AA/A to C)</li>
</ul>
<p>A detailed data description can be found at the end of this page.</p>
<p>To take into account the local conditions within each Entity, exposure data, i.e. the total number of flight hours within each Entity is used as an additional input (CRI normalised results).</p>
<p>The process is visualised in Figure <a href="#fig:cri-data-input">2</a>.</p>

<h3>Occurrences with no severity classification</h3>
<p>All severity unclassified/not assessed events (Severity Category D) are distributed into groups A to E, based on historical distribution (determined using the all available safety data).</p>
<p>The probability of occurrence being assigned to a specific severity category is calculated using historical data, separately for each State/Entity in order to simulate/take into consideration the local conditions.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:cri-sevD">3</a> shows how unassessed occurences (severity D) are distributed into other severity groups.</p>

<h3>Estimated numbers of occurrences</h3>

<h3>CRI calculation using human perception of risk</h3>
<p>Using the estimated total number of occurrences for each type and adding to it
the human perception of their risk, it is possible to calculate the
CRI for each Entity separately.
The simple formula to calculate the CRI is presented below.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{CRI}_i &amp; = \text{No}_{\text{occ_est_i}} * w_i \\

\text{CRI}  &amp; = \sum_{i}^{} \frac{\text{CRI}_i}{\text{Total No}_{{occ}}}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math inline">\(\text{CRI}_i\)</span></dt>
<dd>CRI index for occurrence type <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span></dt>
<dd>weight (based on severity and human perception) assigned to specific type of safety occurrence
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline">\(\text{Total No}_{{occ}}\)</span></dt>
<dd>total number of all occurrences in a year
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the formula above the Weights added to each equation represent the additional human perception of the risk for the specific event so that the CRI can at the end consider the human perception of equivalent risk.</p>
<p>Introduction of Weights to express the severity of the event allows their description in non-monetary terms which have a meaningful and understandable explanation in human perception.</p>
<p>Each weight value for specific Severity category is determined by using the optimisation technique, with the aim to select a combination of weights that will not disturb the computation of the CRI from year to year if significant changes in reporting are introduced. In other words, the optimisation will find which combination of weights result in the lowest standard deviation of CRI values between the years for each Entity.</p>
<p>Due to a large number of variables involved and the enormous number of combinations possible, the optimisation and selection of the Weights combination is done in stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Selection of Weights for accident, all OPS occurrences and TECH occurrences</p></li>
<li><p>Selection of Weights for OPS occurrences based on their type (RI, SMI, UPA, OTHER), taking into consideration overall OPS Weight determined in Step 1</p></li>
<li><p>Selection of Weights for OPS and TECH occurrences based on their severity (AA/A, B, C), taking into consideration overall OPS Weight determined in Step 2</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, each type of weight selection has predefined weight ranges, to allow for an incremental Severity classification order, based on human perception of risk (from accident to Severity C incident, i.e. from high risk to low risk). In other words, each range has an expectation value associated with it.

<div id="cri-normalisation" class="section level3">
<h3>CRI normalisation</h3>
<p>To allow the applicability of the CRI to airspaces with different traffic levels, the CRI is normalised by flight hours for each Entity. The CRInorm is calculated based on the following formula:</p>
<p>CRInorm =CRI/(Number of Flight Hours)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>For CRI calculation, each historical, reported occurrence besides classification, has to have assigned severity and probability.</p>
<p>Modelling of Weights can be performed using any source of safety occurrences data, as long as the input satisfies the minimum data requirements as in the table below. Note, that safety data, should include occurrence severity, reported and calculated using severity classification of the <a href="/acronym/rat/" title="RAT">Risk Assessment Methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p>The RAT classification scheme specifies five qualitative frequency categories (repeatability). However, these values are not commonly reported through the AST. Each State/Entity in principle should develop their own quantitative boundaries, which should consider national traffic volumes and specific operating conditions of the national ATM system.</p>
<p>Therefore, the occurrence probability is calculated using historical data from all available years separately for each Entity in order to simulate/take into consideration the local conditions.</p>
