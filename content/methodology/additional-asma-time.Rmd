The document describing the methodology for the calculation of the additional Arrival Sequencing and Metering (ASMA) time can be downloaded [here](/library/AddASMA_indicator_documentation_mar23.pdf).

This methodology is the result of a review process of the previous methodology (used up to December 2022 in the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System). 

The review was done in collaboration with stakeholders through the creating of a working group. All details about the review work can be found [here](/publications/studies/2022_11_17_prc_apt_cons/).

Results with the old methodology up to December 2022 are available for consultation in our [download page](/data/) and were used in performance reports up to and including PRR 2022.
