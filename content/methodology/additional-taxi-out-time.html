<p>The document describing the methodology for the calculation of the additional taxi-out time can be downloaded <a href="/library/ATXOT_indicator_documentation_mar23.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>This methodology is the result of a review process of the previous methodology (used up to December 2022 in the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System).</p>
<p>The review was done in collaboration with stakeholders through the creating of a working group. All details about the review work can be found <a href="/publications/studies/2022_11_17_prc_apt_cons/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The new methodology is applied starting with the analysis of January 2023 performance and retroactively to 2015.</p>
<p>Results with the old methodology up to December 2022 are available for consultation in our <a href="/data/">download page</a> and were used in performance reports up to and including PRR 2022.</p>
