Complementary to the [EUROCONTROL web page][ectlweb] which provides daily situation updates in an [interactive dashboard][ectl_daily], the goal of the PRC site is to provide relevant high level snapshots of the crisis, particularly related to performance topics as more data becomes available. 

 As a result of COVID-19, the number of flights operating daily in [EUROCONTROL Member States][ectlmemb] declined in March-April by up to -90% compared to the same period in 2019. The analysis below shows the evolution of the daily flights in the [EUROCONTROL Member States][ectlmemb] for the years 2010, 2019 and 2020. The year 2010 was included as a reference because of the volcanic ash crisis from 14-20 April which brought European aviation close to a standstill. <br>
