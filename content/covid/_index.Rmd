With a pandemic sweeping its way across the globe, the entire aviation industry is facing an unprecedented challenge.  
Nobody can currently answer the most pressing question, namely how long will the crisis last, how bad it will be, and how to get back to normality?

Complementary to the [EUROCONTROL web page][ectlweb] which provides daily situation updates in an [interactive dashboard][ectl_daily], the goal of this site is to provide relevant high level snapshots of the crisis particularly related to performance topics as more data becomes available.
