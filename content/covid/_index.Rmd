With a pandemic sweeping its way across the globe, the entire aviation industry is facing an unprecedented challenge.  
Nobody can currently answer the most pressing question, namely how long will the crisis last, how bad it will be, and how to get back to normality?

Complementary to the [EUROCONTROL web page][ectlweb] which provides daily situation updates in an [interactive dashboard][ectl_daily], the goal of this site is to provide relevant high level snapshots of the crisis particularly related to performance topics as more data becomes available. 

The analyisis below shows the evolution of the daily flights in the [EUROCONTROL Member States][ectlmemb] between 01 January and 24 March for the years 2010, 2019 and 2020. The year 2010 was included as a reference because of the volcanic ash crisis from 14-20 April which brought European aviation close to a standstill.
