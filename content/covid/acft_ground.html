The drastic reduction in traffic has forced many aircraft operators to withdraw from service a significant part of their fleet, be it temporarily or permanently.
The analysis of these massive groundings of aircraft across Europe in the dashboard below provides another perspective on the magnitude of the impact on the airline sector, with more than 6000 aircraft grounded in Europe in April and May.</p>
<p>The timeline shows how the majority of the groundings took place in the second half of March, while a clear recovery is observed since the beginning of June, with progressively more aircraft returning to fly in the EUROCONTROL area.</p>
<p>The interactive dashboard below enables an analysis by state, airport or aircraft operator.</p>
