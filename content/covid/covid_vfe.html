<p>The COVID-19 crisis caused an unprecedented reduction in traffic in Europe. The dashboard below has been developed in coordination with <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/environment" title="EUROCONTROL Environmnet Unit">EUROCONTROLâ€™s Environment Unit</a> to monitor the changes in average time in level flight at the top 20 airports in Europe since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020.
The dramatic reduction of traffic at airports resulted in a clear improved vertical flight efficiency for those flights still operating at the top 20 airports.</p>
For more information on the efficiency during climb <a href="/acronym/cco/">(CCO)</a> and descent <a href="/acronym/cdo/">(CDO)</a> including the underlying methodology, please visit also our <a href="/efficiency/vfe">Vertical flight efficiency page</a> in our <a href="/efficiency/">efficiency section</a>.
