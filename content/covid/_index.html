<p>With a pandemic sweeping its way across the globe, the entire aviation industry is facing an unprecedented challenge.<br />
Nobody can currently answer the most pressing question, namely how long will the crisis last, how bad it will be, and how to get back to normality?</p>
<p>Complementary to the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/" title="EUROCONTROL web page">EUROCONTROL web page</a> which provides daily situation updates in an <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html" title="Daily traffic updates">interactive dashboard</a>, the goal of this site is to provide relevant high level snapshots of the crisis particularly related to performance topics as more data becomes available.</p>
<p>The analyisis below shows the evolution of the daily flights in the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/about-us#member-states" title="EUROCONTROL Member States">EUROCONTROL Member States</a> between 01 January and 24 March for the years 2010, 2019 and 2020. The year 2010 was included as a reference because of the volcanic ash crisis from 14-20 April which brought European aviation close to a standstill.</p>
