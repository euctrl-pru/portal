<p>As a result of COVID-19, the number of flights operating daily in <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/about-us#member-states" title="EUROCONTROL Member States">EUROCONTROL Member States</a> declined in March-April by up to -90% compared to the same period in 2019. The analysis below shows the evolution of the daily flights in the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/about-us#member-states" title="EUROCONTROL Member States">EUROCONTROL Member States</a> for the years 2010, 2019 and 2020. The year 2010 was included as a reference because of the volcanic ash crisis from 14-20 April which brought European aviation close to a standstill. <br></p>
