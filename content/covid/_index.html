<p>With a pandemic sweeping its way across the globe, the entire aviation industry is facing an unprecedented challenge.<br />
Nobody can currently answer the most pressing question, namely how long will the crisis last, how bad will it be, and how to get back to normality?</p>
<p>Complementary to the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/" title="EUROCONTROL web page">EUROCONTROL web page</a> which provides daily situation updates in an <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation" title="Daily traffic updates">interactive dashboard</a>, the goal of the PRC site is to provide relevant high level snapshots of the crisis, particularly related to performance topics as more data becomes available.</p>
<p>The analysis below shows the evolution of the daily flights in the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/about-us#member-states" title="EUROCONTROL Member States">EUROCONTROL Member States</a> for the years 2010, 2019 and 2020. The year 2010 was included as a reference because of the volcanic ash crisis from 14-20 April which brought European aviation close to a standstill.
The analysis shows the dramatic reduction in traffic starting at the beginning of March. Although many airlines have already suspended operations the bottom has not yet been reached and traffic is still reducing further.</p>

<p>The table below provides a similar overview at Air Navigation Service Provider level (all controlled flights including overflights). <br>
As usual, the corresponding data will be available for download in the <a href="/data/">data section</a> as soon as we have completed and processed the full month.</p>
