<p>The analysis shows the evolution of the flights (moving 7 day average) in the <a href="/definition/eurocontrol-area/">EUROCONTROL Area</a> for the years 2010, 2019 and 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the dimension of the COVID-19 crisis is of a completely different order of magnitude, the year 2010 was included as a reference because of the volcanic ash crisis from 14-20 April which brought European aviation close to a standstill.</p>
<p>There has been a steady increase of flights since mid-April with a more pronounced increase towards the end of June 2020. In July 2020, traffic continued to increase but still remained 57% below the traffic level at the end of July 2019. <br></p>
