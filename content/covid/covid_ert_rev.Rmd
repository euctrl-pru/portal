This page provides a view on the impact COVID-19 crisis on the en-route (total) [service units](/acronym/su/) (TSUs) and anticipated revenue from en-route charges. Additionally, it provides an estimate of the revenue losses to be borne by the ANSPs and the airspace users under the cost-recovery regimes currently in place.

The geographical scope of the analysis is the [EUROCONTROL Member States](/definition/eurocontrol-area/) which are part of the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/multilateral-agreement-relating-route-charges" target="_blank">Multilateral Agreement relating to Route Charges</a> and on behalf of which the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/crco" target="_blank">Central Route Charges Office of EUROCONTROL (CRCO)</a> collects en-route charges.

The analysis includes 39 States (all EUROCONTROL Member States except Monaco and Ukraine), referred to as CRCO Area in this analysis. The view is broken down in 39 individual [en-route charging zones][ert_cz][^1].

It should be recognised that the information shown in this dashboard do not refer to actual disbursements of cash and only provide indicative information on the estimated loss of revenue. More details on the methodology are available in the “Methodological Note” below. 

The financial figures are shown in EURO and are converted using the exchange rates available [here][ex_rate] .
