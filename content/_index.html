<p>Welcome to the <a href="/about/us/">Performance Review Unit (PRU)</a> ANS performance data portal.
<br></p>
<div id="covid-19-update" class="section level3">
<h3>COVID-19: Update</h3>
<p>The whole industry is at the centre of economic turmoil arising from the COVID-19 outbreak with traffic demand falling at a speed not seen before, as more and more countries introduce travel bans and isolation requirements.<br />
Unlike previous outbreaks (SARS, MERS) which were more regional in scope, the COVID-19 outbreak is global and nobody can answer the most pressing question, namely how long will the crisis last, how bad it will be, and how to get back to normality?
While those questions remain unanswered, the only option is to monitor closely the dynamic situation, take coordinated action, and to prepare as much as possible for the long road back to normality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While we will continue to update the performance data on a monthly basis in the <a href="/data/">data section</a> you can find daily situation reports on the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/" title="EUROCONTROL web page">EUROCONTROL web page</a> in an <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html" title="Daily traffic updates">interactive dashboard</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, we set up a <a href="/covid/">specific page</a> in the analyis section to provide high level snapshots of the crisis and to publish specific performance oriented reviews of the situation as more data becomes available.</p></li>
