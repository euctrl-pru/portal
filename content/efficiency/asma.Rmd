ANS-related inefficiencies on the arrival flow are measured in terms of [arrival ATFM delay](/capacity/atfm_apt/) and [additional time in the arrival sequencing and metering area (ASMA time)](/methodology/additional-asma-time-pi/). Whereas ATFM delays have an impact in terms of delay on the ground, additional ASMA time (airborne holdings) has also a direct impact in terms of fuel burn and emissions. The higher the additional ASMA time, the higher the additional fuel consumption and emissions. 

The underlying data of the results shown in the dashboard belwo are available for download in our [data repository](/data/).
