The ANS related impact on the environment is closely linked to operational performance (fuel efficiency) which is largely driven by inefficiencies in the flight trajectory and associated fuel burn (and emissions). The current best estimate for 2019 is that ANS can influence approximately 6% (11.6 Mt) of the total gate-to-gate fuel burn (“benefit pool”).
The overview below shows a consolidated view of the main components. For more detailed analysis, please consult also the respective sections on this page:

* [Horizontal en-route flight efficiency](/efficiency/hfe/)
* [Vertical flight efficiency](/efficiency/vfe/)
* [Terminal holdings (ASMA)](/efficiency/asma/)
* [Taxi out efficiency](/efficiency/taxiout/)

The underlying data of the results shown in the dashboard below are available for download in our [data repository](/data/).
