The ATM-related impact on climate is closely linked to operational performance (fuel efficiency) which is largely driven by inefficiencies in the flight trajectory and associated fuel burn (and emissions). For every tonne of fuel reduced, an equivalent amount of 3.15t of CO<sub>2</sub> is avoided. Information on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aviation in Europe is available on the [sustainability dashboard](/efficiency/emissions/), powered by the [EUROCONTROL Aviation Sustainability Unit](https://www.eurocontrol.int/aviation-sustainability){target="_blank"}.

For more information on operational efficiency, please consult also the respective sections on this page:

* [Horizontal en-route flight efficiency](/efficiency/hfe/)
* [Vertical flight efficiency](/efficiency/vfe/)
* [Terminal holdings (ASMA)](/efficiency/asma/)
* [Taxi out efficiency](/efficiency/taxiout/)

The underlying data of the results shown in the dashboard below are available for download in our [data repository](/data/).
