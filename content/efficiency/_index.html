<p>ANS performance clearly affects the environmental impact of aviation.
The ANS related impact on the environment is closely linked to operational performance (fuel efficiency) which is largely driven by inefficiencies in the flight trajectory and associated fuel burn (and emissions).</p>
<p>The current best estimate for 2019 is that ANS can influence approximately 6% (11.6 Mt) of the total gate-to-gate fuel burn (“benefit pool”).
Horizontal en-route flight efficiency is the largest single component and also the only component subject to target setting in the Single European Sky, followed by inefficiencies during the arrival phase.</p>
