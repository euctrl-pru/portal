Improved vertical flight efficiency during climb [(CCO)](/acronym/cco/) and descent [(CDO)](/acronym/cdo/) can save substantial amounts of fuel and CO2 and also reduce noise levels in the vicinity of airports. The lower the level segment, the higher the additional fuel consumption.

Together with interested stakeholders and the EUROCONTROL Environment Unit, the [PRC](/about/prc/) has developed a [methodology](/methodology/cd-vertical-flight-efficiency-pi/) to compute level off segments during climb and descent at airports. The results are available for download in our [data repository](/data/). 

The dashboard below shows the average time in level flight at the top 20 airports in Europe since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020. The dramatic reduction of traffic at airports resulted in a clear improved vertical flight efficiency for those flights still operating at the top 30 airports.

* **Vertical en-route flight efficiency**

    This tool provides you with customised reports on vertical en-route flight efficiency for a specific airport pair and
    [AIRAC cycle](https://www.nm.eurocontrol.int/RAD/common/airac_dates.html).
    The electronic reports are free of charge. Once you have entered your name,
    email address and the ICAO codes of the airport pair and AIRAC cycle,
    we will send you the electronic report within 24 hours by email.<br>
