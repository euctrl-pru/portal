#### The Big Picture
**Traffic:** Despite the continuous increase since mid-April 2020, there were a total of 3.47 million fewer flights in the EUROCONTROL Member States compared to the first seven months in 2019 (-54.5% vs. 2019). Focusing on the period May to July, traffic in 2020 was even -74.7% below 2019 levels. <br>

**Charges:** As a consequence of the unprecedented reduction of traffic, revenues from en-route charges between January and July 2020 were -57.0% lower than planned which corresponds to a 2.67 billion Euro loss in the first seven months of 2020. <br>

**Delays:** As can be expected, ATFM en-route delays dropped to zero following the dramatic reduction in traffic in mid-April. Compared to the unacceptably high delays observed in 2019, en-route delays decreased by 84.6% which corresponds to 8.77 million minutes less delay. <br>

#### Road to recovery
The rate of recovery is in line with the [EUROCONTROL "Coordinated Measures" Scenario][ectl_traff] which envisaged around 38% of the 2019 traffic level by the end of July. 

The latest [European NOP 2020 Recovery Plan][NOP_rec] expects to reach close to 60% of the 2019 traffic levels on peak days in September. However, this outlook is highly dependent on the evolution of State restrictions.
