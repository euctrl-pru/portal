<h4>The Big Picture</h4>
<p><strong>Traffic:</strong> Despite the continuous increase since mid-April 2020, there were a total of 3.47 million fewer flights in the EUROCONTROL Member States compared to the first seven months in 2019 (-54.5% vs. 2019). Focusing on the period May to July, traffic in 2020 was even -74.7% below 2019 levels. <br>

<p><strong>Charges:</strong> As a consequence of the unprecedented reduction of traffic, revenues from en-route charges between January and July 2020 were -57.0% lower than planned which corresponds to a 2.67 billion Euro loss in the first seven months of 2020. <br>

<p><strong>Delays:</strong> As can be expected, ATFM en-route delays dropped to zero following the dramatic reduction in traffic in mid-April. Compared to the unacceptably high delays observed in 2019, en-route delays decreased by 84.6% which corresponds to 8.77 million minutes less delay. <br>

<h4>Road to recovery</h4>
<p>The rate of recovery is in line with the <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/covid19#traffic-scenarios" title="Traffic scenarios">EUROCONTROL “Coordinated Measures” Scenario</a> which envisaged around 38% of the 2019 traffic level by the end of July.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.public.nm.eurocontrol.int/PUBPORTAL/gateway/spec/index.html" title="NOP Recovery Plan">European NOP 2020 Recovery Plan</a> expects to reach close to 60% of the 2019 traffic levels on peak days in September. However, this outlook is highly dependent on the evolution of State restrictions.</p>
