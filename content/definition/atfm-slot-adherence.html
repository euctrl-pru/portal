<p>ATFM departure slots are allocated centrally by the Network Manager to hold aircraft on the ground when there is an envisaged imbalance between demand and capacity at airports or en-route.</p>
<p>ATFM slot adherence measures the share of take-offs outside the allocated ATFM window. Within the EU, the monitoring of ATFM slot adherence is required by Regulation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-eu:255/2010" role="doc-biblioref">EU 2010</a>)</span>. ATS units are required to provide information on non-compliance for airports where non-adherence equals or exceeds 20% of regulated departures.</p>
