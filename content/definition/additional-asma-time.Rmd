The Additional ASMA time is the difference between the actual ASMA transit time
and the unimpeded ASMA time calculated for non-congested conditions.

## Unit of Measurement
Minute.

## Calculation of the indicator
Let

* $c$, a combination of aircraft class, ASMA sectors and arrival runway, as
  described in the technical note for
  [unimpeded ASMA time](/definition/unimpeded-asma-time/),
* $f(c)$, a flight characterised by a combination $c$,
* $\textrm{AcASMA}(f(c))$, the actual
  [ASMA transit time](/definition/asma-transit-time/)
  for a flight $f(c)$, i.e. the
  elapsed time between the last entry of the flight $f(c)$ in its ASMA sector and
  its actual landing time ([ALDT](/acronym/aldt/)),
* $\textrm{UASMA}(c)$, the
  [unimpeded ASMA time](/definition/unimpeded-asma-time/)
  for a combination $c$.

The *additional ASMA time*, $\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c))$, is calculated for each flight $f(c)$
as the difference between the actual ASMA transit time $\textrm{AcASMA}(f(c))$ of the
flight and the unimpeded ASMA time $\textrm{UASMA}(c)$:

$$
\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c)) = \textrm{AcASMA}(f(c)) - \textrm{UASMA}(c)
$$

The additional ASMA time, $\textrm{AdASMA}(c)$, for a given combination $c$ is the
average of the additional ASMA time, $\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c))$ of all the flight $f(c)$
characterised by that combination $c$.

The additional ASMA time, $\textrm{AdASMA}$, for a given airport is the weighted
average of the additional ASMA time, $\textrm{AdASMA}(c)$, for all the combinations
$c$ at that airport with their probability of occurrence.
