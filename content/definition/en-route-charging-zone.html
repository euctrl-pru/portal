<p>A route charge is levied for each flight performed in the EUROCONTROL airspace.
The EUROCONTROL airspace is divided into <em>route charging zones</em> as defined by
the Member States.</p>
<p>The EUROCONTROL route charge takes account of three basic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The distance factor (for each charging zone);</li>
<li>The aircraft weight factor; and</li>
<li>The unit rate of charge (for each charging zone).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Unit Rate of charge is established at the beginning of the year and,
normally, remains valid for a calendar year.</p>
<p>The following map shows EUROCONTROL charging zone:</p>
