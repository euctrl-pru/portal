<p>The Additional ASMA time is the difference between the actual ASMA transit time
and the unimpeded ASMA time calculated for non-congested conditions.</p>

[unimpeded ASMA time]({{< relref "/definition/unimpeded-asma-time.md" >}}),</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span>, a flight characterised by a combination <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>,</li>

[ASMA transit time]({{< relref "/definition/asma-transit-time.md" >}})
for a flight <span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span>, i.e.Â the
elapsed time between the last entry of the flight <span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span> in its ASMA sector and
its actual landing time ([ALDT]({{< relref "/acronym/aldt.md" >}})),</li>

</ul>
<p>The <em>additional ASMA time</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c))\)</span>, is calculated for each flight <span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span>
as the difference between the actual ASMA transit time <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AcASMA}(f(c))\)</span> of the
flight and the unimpeded ASMA time <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{UASMA}(c)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c)) = \textrm{AcASMA}(f(c)) - \textrm{UASMA}(c)
\]</span></p>
<p>The additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(c)\)</span>, for a given combination <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the
average of the additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c))\)</span> of all the flight <span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span>
characterised by that combination <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}\)</span>, for a given airport is the weighted
average of the additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(c)\)</span>, for all the combinations
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> at that airport with their probability of occurrence.</p>
