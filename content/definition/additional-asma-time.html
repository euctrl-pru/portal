<p>The additional Arrival Sequencing and Metering (ASMA) time provides an approximate measure of the average inbound queuing time on the inbound traffic flow, during times that the airport is congested.
This indicator is calculated as the difference between the actual ASMA transit time and a reference ASMA time estimated for each inbound flow.</p>
