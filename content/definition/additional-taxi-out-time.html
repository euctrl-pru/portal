<p>The <em>additional taxi-out time</em> provides an approximate measure for the average departure runway queuing time on the outbound traffic flow, during times that the airport is congested. This indicator is calculated as the difference between the actual taxi-out time and a reference taxi-out time estimated for each stand-runway combination.</p>
