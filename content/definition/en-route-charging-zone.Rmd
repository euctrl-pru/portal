A route charge is levied for each flight performed in the EUROCONTROL airspace.
The EUROCONTROL airspace is divided into *route charging zones* as defined by
the Member States.

The EUROCONTROL route charge takes account of three basic elements:

* The distance factor (for each charging zone);
* The aircraft weight factor; and
* The unit rate of charge (for each charging zone).

The Unit Rate of charge is established at the beginning of the year and,
normally, remains valid for a calendar year.

The following map shows EUROCONTROL charging zone:

});
