The *additional taxi-out time* provides an approximate measure for the average departure runway queuing time on the outbound traffic flow, during times that the airport is congested. This indicator is calculated as the difference between the actual taxi-out time and a reference taxi-out time estimated for each stand-runway combination.

## Unit of Measurement
Minutes per IFR departure [min/dep].

## Methodology
The methodology for the calculation of the additional taxi-out time can be found [here](/methodology/additional-taxi-out-time/).
