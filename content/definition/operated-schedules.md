The percentage (%) of airline schedules that match to an operated flight (with ATC flight plan) compared to the total number of expected flights. 

Flight schedules information is loaded every day including data for the ongoing date and next two days. If a flight plan and a flight schedule fulfill multiple conditions (slot times, airports and callsign) they will be matched. The indicator is calculated making use of the total number of matched flight plans and schedules that were not related to any flight plan for the selected period. The schedule information consists of data received from [EUACA](/acronym/euaca) and third parties.
