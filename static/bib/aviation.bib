  abstract = {Significant efforts are underway to modernize global air traffic management systems. Flight efficiency is a major political design criterion. This paper addresses the identification and measurement of ATM related constraints on vertical flight efficiency with a focus on continuous descent operations. Efficiency of flight operations has become a key driver for identifying bottlenecks and constraints imposed by ATM on airspace user preferred flight trajectories. In particular, measures aiming at fuel-efficient operations attract a lot of attention. This paper reports on the work jointly performed by the FAA and EUROCONTROL to address vertical flight efficiency. Based on an empirical study of trajectory data for US and European airports, a vertical profile analysis algorithm has been developed considering research experiences and stakeholder consultations of both teams. This work was performed as the preparatory action of the joint US/Europe comparison report. The results include a joint and harmonized algorithm to describe the vertical trajectory profile and the initial definition of metrics for the performance measurement. This harmonized algorithm will be further be validated and refined as part of the US/Europe comparison report including a wider set of airports. Demonstrating the general feasibility, the algorithm will be further promoted for use in international performance activities under ICAO.},

The concept of a Composite Risk Index (CRI) that could measure the performance of European ATM systems as a whole or also its individual entities (service providers or Member States) is explained. In simple words, CRI presents a cumulative risk value calculated aggregating all reported, assessed and severity classified safety-related incidents to form an index. This measure of risk exposure is based on probability and severity that considers the human perception of equivalent risk.
The report describes the computation of the CRI, logic behind it, its use (on the example of risk exposure of all EUROCONTOL Member States), limitations and lastly areas of potential improvement.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, regional Air Traffic Management benchmarking focuses on comparing delay statistics to foster a better understanding of the different practices in the different regional systems. As part of the FAA and EUROCONTROL’s ongoing U.S./Europe comparison activity, a closer look at Air Traffic Flow Management was taken to compare the operational practices and performance in each system and the application of Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI). A joint typology of traffic management initiatives was developed supporting the mapping of the varying regional concepts and terminology. Initial findings based on 2015 were previously presented. Meanwhile, the data covers a period of four years (2015-2018), supporting not only a regional comparison in a snapshot of time, but also a broader study of trends and their underlying causes. When ATFM actions (i.e. TMIs) resulted in more reportable delay, the data shows that in both systems this is primarily driven by an increase in the number of delayed flights, rather than changes in average delay per delayed flight. However, the study shows that there still are significant differences in how this extra delay is generated through ATFM. This research helps both groups improve their ability to analyze the effectiveness of ATFM and learn from each other’s experience, and will form an essential basis for future regional comparisons.},
